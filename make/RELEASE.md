# PSOC™ Edge GNU make Build System Release Notes
This repo provides the build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming PSOC™ Edge applications. Builds can be run either through a command-line interface (CLI) or through a supported IDE such as Eclipse or VS Code.

### What's Included?
This release of the PSOC™ Edge GNU make build recipe includes complete support for building, programming, and debugging PSOC™ Edge application projects. It is expected that a code example contains a top level make file for itself and references a Board Support Package (BSP) that defines specific items, like the PSOC™ Edge part, for the target board. Supported functionality includes the following:

* Supported operations:
    * Build
    * Program
    * Debug
    * IDE Integration (Eclipse, VS Code, IAR, uVision)
* Supported toolchains:
    * GCC
    * IAR
    * ARM Compiler 6
    * LLVM Embedded Toolchain for Arm

### What Changed?
#### v2.3.1
* Improved missing toolchains handling.
* Improved FreeRTOS component flag handling for IAR toolchain.

#### v2.3.0
* Initial release.

### Product/Asset Specific Instructions
Builds require that the ModusToolbox™ tools be installed on your machine. This comes with the ModusToolbox™ install. On Windows machines, it is recommended that CLI builds be executed using the Cygwin.bat located in ModusToolBox/tools\_x.y/modus-shell install directory. This guarantees a consistent shell environment for your builds.

To list the build options, run the "help" target by typing "make help" in CLI. For a verbose documentation on a specific subject type "make help CY\_HELP={variable/target}", where "variable" or "target" is one of the listed make variables or targets.
