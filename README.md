## Overview

The ModusToolbox™ Device Support Library provides all nessesary device specific components to be used during software development for the PSE8xxGP family of devices.

## Features
The package includes:
*  PSOC™ Edge MCU Peripheral Driver Library (PDL) - provides, device header files, start-up code, and peripheral drivers as a set of low-level APIs to configure, initialize, and use various supported peripheral drivers
* Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) - provides high-level API wrappers around lower-level device specific APIs(such as PSOC™ MCU PDL)
* Device Utilities (device-utils) - handles the pre-defined System Power Management (SysPm) callback implementations for peripherals which require special handling when the MCU enters or exits
DeepSleep
* make - provides build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming device applications
